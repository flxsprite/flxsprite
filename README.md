hi im koi

im a 16 year old self proclaimed pro coder (I forget how my code works 90% of the time)

i code stuff because i dont wanna end up like the people in my school vaping, smoking, etc etc.

i also work on sonic runners revival now (as of 5/30/2025)

notice how my life has gotten slightly better ever since i got rejected :pray:

ok bye

90% of my projects WILL be open source (eventually, UNLESS it's a decompilation of a paid game, I don't wanna get sued lol), I don't fw that closed source shit
